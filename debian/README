The Debian Package kvaser-convert-lib
----------------------------

This project is based on Kvaser CANLib SDK.
Original source is available at https://www.kvaser.com/download/.

The project goals are:

- Maintain a version which is buildable both on Linux (using gcc as compiler) and Windows (using MinGW as compiler).
- Build of deb packages for Debian-based distributions.
- Keep up to date with upstream code provided by Kvaser, but with git tracked source (source is currently only distributed as tarball).
